        				<p>Hello! My name is Kylie Kissinger, and I am a first year at Western Colorado University. I am majoring in graphic design with a minor in web design. I am a lover of art and creativity. One of my biggest hobbies that has inspired me in many ways along my art journy is books. I love fantasy books and getting lost in different worlds. This website is a refelction of the love of books and the book community. I wanted to be able to share about my book journey and allow for a place where you can get recomendations and can also give me recomendations. </p>
