			<h1 id="important1" class="one"> The Art of Imagination </h1>
				<p class="important2"> Art is only a form of imagination. Each form of art is just some type of take on someone's imagination. Every piece of my art comes from a mind filled with dreams and places many things of this world but also many things not of this world. The work of other people is just a reflection of their imagination, and this includes not only physical artwork but books and writings as well.</p>

        			<p>My artwork is one of the best ways I can express myself and my mind. Much of my work is bringing out my imagination and stuff that you only find within my imagination. Other pieces of my work represent things that I love the look of and things that are meaningful to me. </p>

        			<p>Books are one of my favorite forms of art. I have loved reading for a long time and one of the main reasons I love to read is how they can completely put me into a whole different world. It expands my imagination past what I thought it ever could. Specifically the <cite> Red Queen </cite> series. These books made me feel emotions stronger than I ever have before, and they gave me a chance to experience things I never will in life on my own.</p>

        			<p>This book series in another one that I love and still think about many years after reading it. It is the book series that had a lasting impact on me and made me feel emotions I had never fully experienced in real life. It allowed me to be in a whole different world. </p>
